# Django

## Overview

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It’s free and open source.

## Features

- **Framework, Not a Library**: Django is a framework where all processes and activities are governed by the framework itself. Developers plugin their Python code into the structure provided by Django, which then executes and runs the application.
  
- **MVC/MVT Design Pattern**: Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-Template (MVT) design pattern. This helps keep the UI (frontend) and business logic (backend) separate, promoting organized and maintainable code.

- **Rapid Development**: Django speeds up the development process because it comes with a lot of built-in features and libraries. This means you don’t need to build everything from scratch. You can simply plug in the necessary classes/libraries, inherit them, customize your code, and run your app.

- **Templates**: Django provides a robust templating system that allows for dynamic HTML generation.

- **Custom Authentication**: Django offers custom authentication mechanisms to handle user authentication and authorization efficiently.

- **Security Robustness**: Django comes with many security features out-of-the-box, making it easier to protect your applications from common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

- **Admin Panel**: Django includes a built-in admin panel, which is a powerful interface for managing application data.

- **Third-Party Libraries**: Django supports numerous third-party libraries, which can be easily integrated to extend the functionality of your applications.
